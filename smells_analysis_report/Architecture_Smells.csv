Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell,Status,Justification
backend,secretstuffs.application.services,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [VerificationTokenServiceTest; VerificationTokenService]; [ChatRoomServiceTest; ChatRoomService; ChatMessageService; ChatMessageServiceTest]; [AuthServiceTest; AuthService; EmailService]; [UserServiceTest; UserService]; [DonationServiceTest; DonationService]; [ItemPostServiceTest; ItemPostService]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.4,False Positive ,"This is a false positive because the services and their tests are logically grouped under the application services layer, each handling distinct concerns like authentication, chat, or donations. Their coexistence in the same package is standard in layered architecture and does not violate cohesion principles."
backend,secretstuffs.controllers,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ChatControllerTest; ChatController]; [DonationController]; [ItemPostController]; [AuthController]; [UserController]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.83,False Positive ,"This is a false positive because controllers in a backend application are logically grouped to handle distinct concerns (e.g., authentication, donations, or user management) while serving as entry points for the respective features. The detected lack of cohesion reflects the diverse functionalities of the application, not a design flaw."
backend,secretstuffs.infrastructure.repositories,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): secretstuffs.domain.entities,False Positive ,"This is a false positive because repositories are inherently designed to depend on entities as part of their responsibility to manage database interactions. This dependency is stable and essential in typical layered architectures, reflecting standard design practices rather than a design flaw."
backend,secretstuffs.infrastructure.repositories,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [DonationRepository]; [ItemPostRepository]; [ChatRoomRepository]; [UserRepository]; [VerificationTokenRepository]; [ChatMessageRepository]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 1.0,False Positive ,"This is a false positive because repositories in a layered architecture are designed to handle data persistence for different entities like donations, users, or chat messages. Grouping them under the repositories package is a standard organizational practice, reflecting logical separation rather than a violation of cohesion principles."
backend,secretstuffs.domain.entities,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [Donation; User; ItemPost]; [ChatRoom]; [VerificationToken]; [ChatMessage]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.67,False Positive ,"This is a false positive because entities in the domain layer are meant to represent the core data structures of the application, encompassing various features like donations, users, and chat. Their coexistence in the entities package reflects the logical organization of domain objects and does not indicate a lack of cohesion."
